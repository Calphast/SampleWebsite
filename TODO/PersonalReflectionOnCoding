Im leaving the javascript for later

The MainPage file is really messy... there are some things to note:
    The classes dont have the best names
    The structure really needs a fixing; I didn't follow the figma structuring
    the "style" on some could be easily condensed into individual classes and
        each of them could be modified accordingly

The carrer pages are done for now, since I want to move on to other things
    The classes have much better names
    the structure is much cleaner, but could use a little more work
