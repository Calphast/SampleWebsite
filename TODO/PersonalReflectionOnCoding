Im leaving the javascript for later

The MainPage file is really messy... there are some things to note:
    The classes dont have the best names
    The structure really needs a fixing; I didn't follow the figma structuring
    the "style" on some could be easily condensed into individual classes and
        each of them could be modified accordingly

The Careers page will try to follow a more structure and balanced approach on HTML and CSS coding
